## Accessibility Notice

For those visually impaired, I am using [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) to test and ensure that the application, once it becomes that, will be usable.

For Windows visually impaired users without NVDA set up for Java applications:

1. Navigate to Control Panel.
2. Navigate to Ease of Access: Optimize Visual Display.
3. Traverse to until you hear Enable Java Access Bridge
4. Apply these changes.  Congratulations, you can now ear much more information regarding various applications than you could previously.
